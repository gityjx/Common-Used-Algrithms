# A simple collection of common-used-algrithms 

## These algrithms have be implemeted using following computer languages:

- Python
- javascript
- C#
- Python


**and I hope more languages can be contained in the resposity and I am keeping tyring to do it!**

## These algrithms are classified according to cooresponding data structure, the followings are some of them:

- Linear list(Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List and Dictionary.)
- Tree (Binary tree, Balanced bianry tree, B tree and so on.)
- Graph

**Maybe a better classification will be presented in future.**
